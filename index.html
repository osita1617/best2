        <p>The movie “Invictus” is a biographical themed movie that revolves around Nelson Mandela’s efforts on identifying the development problems of South Africa and the strategies he implemented in order to unite South Africans after winning the presidential election on May 10th, 1994. </p>
        <p>The movie reenacts the inspiring true story of how Nelson Mandela, the former President of South Africa knowing that his country was racially divided believed he could bring South Africans together through the universal language of sport and decided to join forces with the former Captain of the South Africa's rugby team, Francois Pienaar to help unite their country. </p>
        <p>In order to understand how Mandela brought about this development growth in South Africa, one must first have a clear understanding of the various definitions of development communication and how these definitions were each implemented in Mandela’s quest for the developmental growth of South Africa by uniting its people using the universal language of sport.</p>
